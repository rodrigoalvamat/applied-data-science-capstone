## Project Background and Context​

SpaceX is holding a remarkable position in the commercial space industry as a result of the low cost of launching a rocket. According to the company, the standard payment plan for a Falcon 9 launch is $62 million; while the cost of other providers exceeds $165 million. Much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the rocket's first stage.
## Problems Analyzed​

 1. What determines whether a rocket will land successfully?​

 2. Which variables have the greatest influence on the landing success rate?​

 3. Can we estimate the cost of a launch by predicting whether the first stage will land?
